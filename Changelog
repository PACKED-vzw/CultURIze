  - Added a hard reset button, which clears the cache and deletes all files locate in the repo folder.
    button added in the header of main.html page
    button added bellow the create account of the login page
  - Changed css for the topbar button and the new link on the login page
  - Enlarged the input for commit message, pull request title, pull request body.
    Note: it may be interesting to change the design and set TextArea instead of Inputs
  - Solved an issue where when we uploaded the csv files multiple times in succession it said the git broke, which was not True
  - Added a dialog asking the user if he is sure to close the app when he is transforming a CSV
    This dialog aims to prevent a user from closing his window and lose the current transformation
  - Various little fixes
